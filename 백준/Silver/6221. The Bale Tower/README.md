### 문제 설명

<p>Always bored with cud-chewing, the cows have invented a new game. One cow retrieves a set of N (3 <= N <= 20) hay bales from the shed each of which is one unit high. Each bale also has some unique width and unique breadth.</p>

<p>A second cow tries to choose a set of bales to make the tallest stack of bales in which each bale can be placed only on a bale whose own width and breadth are smaller than the width and breadth of the bale below. Bales can not be rotated to interchange the width and breadth.</p>

<p>Help the cows determine the highest achievable tower that can be legally built form a set of bales.</p>

</ul>

<p> </p>
